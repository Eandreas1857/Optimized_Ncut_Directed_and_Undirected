# Getting started
This module it the realization of algorthms from two different papers on finidng the optimized cut of both directed and undirect graphs. See the `notebooks` folder for detailed examples of finding optimal clustering for both directed and undirected graphs. 

__Dependencies:__ Python 3.7.6, networkx, graphviz, numpy, scripy, IPython.display.

__Paper References:__ https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~jshi/papers/pami_ncut.pdf, https://sites.stat.washington.edu/mmp/Papers/sdm-wcuts.pdf

To install, do
```bash 
cd Optimized_Ncut_Directed_and_Undirected
. install.sh
```
